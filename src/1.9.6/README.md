Welcome to the immudb documentation. Great to see you here!

immudb is a database written in Go, but unlike other databases, it is immutable: history is preserved and can't be changed without clients noticing.

immudb can operate as a key-value, relational (SQL) or document database, making it a truly no-SQL database.

immudb can be run as full database server with replicas or easily embedded as a lightweight database into application.
