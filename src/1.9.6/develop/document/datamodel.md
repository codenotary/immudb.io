### Collection

A collection is a container for documents of a similar type. Each database can have one or many collections. The documents within a collection can have various structures, but they must all be JSON files. Collections allow you to store and manage related documents together, making it easier to search and retrieve relevant data.

### Documents
Documents are JSON files containing structured data that are stored within a collection. Each document can have multiple versions, allowing you to track changes and maintain a history of modifications.
