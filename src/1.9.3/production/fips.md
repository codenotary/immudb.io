# FIPS 140-2

<WrappedSection>

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 publication describes United States government-approved security requirements for cryptographic modules. [FIPS-140](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final) series is a collection of computer security standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the United States government. FIPS 140â€“2 defines the critical security parameters vendors must use for encryption before selling their products to the U.S government.

For a fully FIPS-compliant deployment of immudb a few things are required:

- immudb must be compiled with a FIPS validated cryptographic module
- immudb must be configured to use FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithms
- immudb components (immuadmin and immuclient) must be compiled with a FIPS-validated cryptographic module

For immudb, adherence to FIPS 140-2 is ensured by:

- Using FIPS approved / NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithms through the use of `goboring/golang` container image. Since the native go crypto standard library is not FIPS compliant, we use the Google-provided Go implementation that has patches on top of standard Go to enable integrating BoringCrypto. immudb components are built with this image as a build base.
- Enabling [`fipsonly`](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/dev.boringcrypto/src/crypto/tls/fipsonly/fipsonly.go) mode to restrict all TLS configuration in immudb binaries to FIPS-approved settings.

### Limitations

- Currently the builds with FIPS-compliance are only available on `linux-amd64` architecture.
- There is an overhead in calling into BoringCrypto via cgo for the crypto library functions, which incurs a performance penalty. The library performs slower than the built-in crypto library. Hence you could see a performance drop of ~15% when using a FIPS-compliant immudb server.

### Using FIPS-compliant binaries

You can download the immudb binary from the [latest releases](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/releases) on Github. The FIPS-compliant binaries have a `-fips` suffix. (e.g. immudb-v1.4.x-Linux-amd64-fips)

### Using FIPS-compliant docker images

You can pull immudb FIPS-compliant docker images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/codenotary/immudb) and run it in a ready-to-use container. The FIPS-compliant docker images have a `-fips` suffix. (e.g. codenotary/immudb-fips:latest)
