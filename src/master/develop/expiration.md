# Data Expiration

It's possible to achieve data expiration by using the `ExpirableSet` function. It provides logical deletion, it means that it is not phisically deleted from db, but it's not possible to query it anymore after deletion.

```go

    _, err = client.ExpirableSet(ctx, []byte("expirableKey"), []byte("expirableValue"), time.Now())
    if  err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
	//the following will raise an error with key not found
    _, err = client.Get(ctx, []byte("expirableKey"))
	if err == nil || !strings.Contains(err.Error(), "key not found") {
		log.Fatalf("expecting key not found error: %v", err)
	}
