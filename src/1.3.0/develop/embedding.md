# Embedding immudb in your application

Using the Go client SDK means you are connecting to a immudb database server. There are cases where you don't want a separate server but embed immudb directly in the same application process, as a library.

immudb already provides an embeddable key-value store in the [embedded](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/tree/master/embedded) package.
The following example shows how to create or open a store, write some data and read it back.
