## vcn notarize

Notarize an asset onto the blockchain

### Synopsis


Notarize an asset onto the blockchain.

Notarization calculates the SHA-256 hash of a digital asset 
(file, directory, container's image). 
The hash (not the asset) and the desired status of TRUSTED are then 
cryptographically signed by the signer's secret (private key). 
Next, these signed objects are sent to the blockchain where the signer’s
trust level and a timestamp are added. 
When complete, a new blockchain entry is created that binds the asset’s
signed hash, signed status, level, and timestamp together. 

Note that your asset will not be uploaded but processed locally.

Assets are referenced by passed ARG with notarization only accepting 
1 ARG at a time.

ARG must be one of:
  <file>
  file://<file>
  dir://<directory>
  git://<repository>
  docker://<image>
  podman://<image>


```
vcn notarize [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --attr key=value   add user defined attributes (repeat --attr for multiple entries)
      --hash string      specify the hash instead of using an asset, if set no ARG(s) can be used
  -h, --help             help for notarize
  -n, --name string      set the asset name
      --no-ignore-file   if set, .vcnignore will be not written inside the targeted dir
  -p, --public           when notarized as public, the asset name and metadata will be visible to everyone
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.vcn/config.json)
  -o, --output string   output format, one of: --output=json|--output=yaml|--output=''
```
