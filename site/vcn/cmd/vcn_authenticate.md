## vcn authenticate

Authenticate assets against the blockchain

### Synopsis


Authenticate assets against the blockchain.

Authentication is the process of matching the hash of a local asset to 
a hash on the blockchain. 
If matched, the returned result (the authentication) is the blockchain-stored
metadata that’s bound to the matching hash. 
Otherwise, the returned result status equals UNKNOWN.

Assets are referenced by the passed arg(s), with authentication accepting 
1 or more arg(s) at a time. Multiple assets can be authenticated at the 
same time while passing them within arg(s).

The exit code will be 0 only if all assets' statuses are equal to TRUSTED. 
Otherwise, the exit code will be 1.

Note that your assets will not be uploaded but processed locally.
